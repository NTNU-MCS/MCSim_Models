For each student project using this repository:

1) Read the "IntroducingGIT.pptx" and "Simulink programming guidelines.docx" documents.

2) Create your own branch from the Master.

3) In Matlab preferences --> Simulink preferences --> General: 
   - Select “Simulation cache folder” and “Code generation folder” to a local folder on your computer and not the working folder 
     under the Git repository. This avoids the annoying “slprj” folders, etc., to be included in the library.

4) Include a folder under StudPrj where you put your project-specific simulation models (which are based on the MCSim_Models library). 
   - Start your folder name with YEAR-MONTH NAME (e.g. 2018-10 Kari Nordmann).
   - These folders can then be committed and pulled to the master. 

5) Any generic code functions that you make, that you believe to be of general interest to others, please include these in the MSSfiles folder. 

6) If you find bugs, please update, commit, and share with the others.
